# Coding-Portfolio

To whom ever it may concern,

This archive is simply a compilation of a lot of my coding projects over the years, whether they be from school projects, or from independent study.

Through these examples I hope that you will be able to understand a little bit of how I program and solve problems using code.

More importantly I hope that as you visit these past projects that you will discover a little bit of the passion that I have coding and solving problems,
  because one day I hope to make the world a better place problem solving. Whether it's through programming or simple problem solving, I aspire towards
  something great and hope to be able to leave my mark.
